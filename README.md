This repository contains my capstone project for the Advanced Business Analytics Specialization offered by the University of Colorado Boulder on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analytics-business).

This capstone was completed as part of my academic journey in business analytics. It represents a learning milestone, where I applied advanced data analytics and business intelligence techniques to a real-world business case (https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analytics-business-capstone/supplement/x3Ty4/introduction-to-the-project).

Although the original instructions suggested completing the project in Excel, I decided to implement it using Python due to technical constraints and to strengthen my skills in programming and data science. During this specialization, I noticed that very few participants had documented their capstone projects publicly. By sharing this repository, I aim to provide a learning resource for others following the course, showing how the project can be implemented in Python.

The project includes: data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and actionable business recommendations.

This repository is preserved to document my progression in analytics. Since completing this capstone, I have been developing more advanced and diverse projects on Kaggle and GitHub, focusing on machine learning, NLP, computer vision, time series forecasting, and MLOps.
